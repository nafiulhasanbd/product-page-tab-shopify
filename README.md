# product-page-tab-shopify
This code will work to make the tabs in product page


I have added 3 Files. 
1. Copy the code from tabs.liquid and create a tabs.liquid file inside Snippet and paste those code
2. copy the script and paste at the bottom of theme.liquid file
3. Copy the CSS and paste inside the stylesheet file.

That's All Enjoy !
